In the programming language of your choice, you will be building a simple application that allows a user to submit a file (basket.csv, for example â€“ which has also been provided) and returns details about that data. The executable program should accept a file (of fruits) as a run time parameter.

* The submission should include the source code, contain instructions for running the application, be clear and easy to understand, and the application should return the following information:
    1.	Total number of fruit
    2.	Total types of fruit
    3.	The number of each type of fruit in descending order
    4.	The characteristics (size, color, shape, etc.) of each fruit by type
    5.	Have any fruit been in the basket for over 3 days

Example: python solution.py basket

* Total number of fruit: 123

* Types of fruit: 7

* The number of each type of fruit in descending order:
    * apple: 33
    * pear: 23
    * orange: 22
    * grapefruit: 21
    * pineapple: 15
    * watermelon: 7
    * peach: 2

* The characteristics (size, color, shape, etc.) of each fruit by type
    * 4 apples: sweet, red
    * 5 oranges: round, sweet
    * 10 grapefruits: bitter, yellow
    * 3 pineapple: prickly, sweet

* Have any fruit been in the basket for over 3 days?
    * 4 oranges and 5 pineapples are over 3 days old

* Please upload all contents to a shared folder (Google Drive, etc) and send the link to it for review.  The files usually get rejected by mail servers if sent directly *
